Node PopulateFolder Pseudo Code:
Need a constant for the mount points for Org and Location
Need a constant for the UNC address of the fileserver
Need to take the Pi folder as an argument
Need to decide whether this gets called once (and handles both Org and Location) or twice (with the option specified)
Need to remember to clean out existing links

Search Down:
Start by reading the base directory (fs.readdir)
	for each file in the list, test it to see if it's a directory (fs.stat)
		if it's a directory, apply the current match
			if match, walk that directory
			if no match in the directory, declare best match and call walkback from the directory
			
Walk Back:
while current directory is not base directory
	make a link to the current directory and place it in the Pi folder
	Normalize the current directory with .. appended to it
